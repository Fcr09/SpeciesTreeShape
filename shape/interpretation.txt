Certainly! Let's explain each of these tree balance indices, detailing what they stand for and how they reflect the balance or imbalance of a tree. These indices are commonly used in phylogenetics and tree analysis to quantify the symmetry and shape of rooted trees.

1. **Rooted Quartet Index (`rQuartetI`)**:
   - **What it is**: The rooted quartet index measures the proportion of balanced quartets in a tree compared to all possible quartets.
   - **How it reflects balance**: In a rooted tree, a quartet is a subset of four leaves, and there are several ways these can be arranged. A balanced quartet is one where the quartet splits into two pairs at the root. The more balanced quartets a tree has, the higher the rooted quartet index.
   - **Interpretation**: A higher rooted quartet index indicates a more balanced tree, as it suggests that, on average, subsets of four leaves are evenly split.

2. **Sackin Index (`sackinI`)**:
   - **What it is**: The Sackin index sums the depths of all leaves in the tree.
   - **How it reflects balance**: The depth of a leaf is the number of edges from the root to that leaf. In a perfectly balanced tree, all leaves are at the same depth, resulting in a lower Sackin index.
   - **Interpretation**: A lower Sackin index indicates a more balanced tree, whereas a higher value suggests imbalance due to leaves being at varying depths.

3. **Colless Index (`collessI`)**:
   - **What it is**: The Colless index sums the absolute differences in the sizes of left and right subtrees for all internal nodes.
   - **How it reflects balance**: It quantifies the imbalance at each node by comparing the number of descendant leaves in its left and right subtrees.
   - **Interpretation**: A higher Colless index indicates greater imbalance, as there are more significant differences between subtree sizes.

4. **B1 Index (`B1I`)**:
   - **What it is**: The B1 index is based on the variance of leaf depths, normalized by the mean leaf depth.
   - **How it reflects balance**: It measures the spread of leaf depths; more variance implies greater imbalance.
   - **Interpretation**: A higher B1 index suggests a more imbalanced tree due to a wider distribution of leaf depths.

5. **B2 Index (`B2I`)**:
   - **What it is**: The B2 index is the mean of the squared leaf depths.
   - **How it reflects balance**: It emphasizes larger depths more than smaller ones, highlighting deep leaves that contribute to imbalance.
   - **Interpretation**: A higher B2 index indicates more imbalance, as it reflects the presence of leaves that are far from the root.

6. **Average Leaf Depth (`avgLeafDepI`)**:
   - **What it is**: The average depth of all leaves in the tree.
   - **How it reflects balance**: In a balanced tree, leaves are closer to the root, resulting in a lower average depth.
   - **Interpretation**: A lower average leaf depth suggests a more balanced tree.

7. **Average Vertex Depth (`avgVertDep`)**:
   - **What it is**: The average depth of all nodes (both internal nodes and leaves) in the tree.
   - **How it reflects balance**: Similar to average leaf depth but considers all nodes, providing a holistic view of tree balance.
   - **Interpretation**: A lower average vertex depth indicates a more balanced tree structure.

8. **Maximum Depth of the Tree (`maxDepth`)**:
   - **What it is**: The longest path from the root to any leaf.
   - **How it reflects balance**: A greater maximum depth can indicate imbalance if only some leaves are at that depth.
   - **Interpretation**: A smaller maximum depth suggests a more balanced tree where leaves are uniformly distant from the root.

9. **Maximum Width of the Tree (`maxWidth`)**:
   - **What it is**: The maximum number of nodes at any single depth level.
   - **How it reflects balance**: A balanced tree often has a larger width at the middle levels.
   - **Interpretation**: A higher maximum width may indicate balance, showing that the tree expands evenly at certain depths.

10. **Stairs1 Index (`stairs1`)**:
    - **What it is**: The Stairs1 index sums the differences in the number of leaves between the larger and smaller subtrees at each internal node.
    - **How it reflects balance**: It captures the cumulative imbalance at all nodes.
    - **Interpretation**: A higher Stairs1 index indicates a more imbalanced tree due to greater discrepancies in subtree sizes.

11. **Stairs2 Index (`stairs2`)**:
    - **What it is**: Similar to Stairs1 but often sums the squares of the differences in subtree leaf counts.
    - **How it reflects balance**: By squaring the differences, it emphasizes larger imbalances more than smaller ones.
    - **Interpretation**: A higher Stairs2 index signifies greater imbalance, particularly highlighting nodes with large subtree size differences.

12. **Symmetry Nodes Index (`symNodesI`)**:
    - **What it is**: Counts the number of internal nodes where the left and right subtrees have the same number of leaves.
    - **How it reflects balance**: Symmetric nodes contribute to a balanced overall tree structure.
    - **Interpretation**: A higher symmetry nodes index indicates a more balanced tree, as symmetry is a hallmark of balance.

13. **Total Cophenetic Index (`totCophI`)**:
    - **What it is**: The total cophenetic index sums the cophenetic values (the depth of the most recent common ancestor) for all pairs of leaves.
    - **How it reflects balance**: In balanced trees, many leaf pairs share recent common ancestors, resulting in lower cophenetic sums.
    - **Interpretation**: A lower total cophenetic index suggests a more balanced tree, whereas a higher value indicates that many leaf pairs share ancestors deep in the tree, reflecting imbalance.

**Overall Interpretation**:
- **Lower Values in Indices**: Generally, for indices like Sackin, Colless, B1, B2, Stairs1, Stairs2, and Total Cophenetic, lower values suggest a more balanced tree.
- **Higher Values in Indices**: For indices like the Rooted Quartet Index, Maximum Width, and Symmetry Nodes Index, higher values indicate greater balance.
- **Depth-Related Indices**: Average leaf and vertex depths, as well as maximum depth, provide insights into how uniformly the leaves are distributed in terms of their distance from the root.

These indices provide different perspectives on tree balance by focusing on various aspects such as leaf depths, subtree sizes, and symmetry. By analyzing multiple indices, one can gain a comprehensive understanding of the tree's structural balance.
