Datasets (and methods still to run/fix):
1KP - ASTRAL, ASTER
Songmammal% - CASTER
Fengfrog% - CASTER
Viburnum^ - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC, ASTRID
Characoid^ - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC, ASTRID
Anuran* - CASTER
Canis - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC, ASTRID
Lepidop - ASTRAL
Morelplant** - ALL
Seedplant - TreeQMC


Species Trees:
Some datasets claim to have species trees. Have not found many clear ones, but may need to refine this list.

After estimating gene trees on MSAs (?):
Oryza* - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC, ASTRID
Lamp* - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC, ASTRID
Fumaria* - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC, ASTRID
Batra* - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC, ASTRID
Anoplura* - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC, ASTRID
Anuran* - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC, ASTRID, CASTER

Completed Datasets (as far as I can tell):
Shenanimal
UCE
Avian

Pseudapis
Shenfungi
Shenplant
Cetacean
Papilionidae



Key
^ - Need gene tree, appears to only have species tree right now
* - Has MSAs available, may want to estimate gene trees with them, and re-run ASTRAL-III/IV, ASTRID, TREE-QMC
% - May have MSAs available, need to find
** - Need to located dataset
