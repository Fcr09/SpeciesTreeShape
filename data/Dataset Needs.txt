Datasets (and methods still to run/fix):
1KP - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC
Songmammal* - CASTER
Fengfrog* - ASTRAL, Tree-QMC, CASTER
Oryza* - ASTRAL, ASTER, Tree-QMC, ASTRID

^ - Need gene tree, appears to only have species tree right now
* - Has MSAs available, may want to estimate gene trees with them, and re-run ASTRAL-III/IV, ASTRID, TREE-QMC

Species Trees:
Some datasets claim to have species trees. Have not found many clear ones, but may need to refine this list.


Datasets to estimate gene trees (?):
Songmammal
Fengfrog
Oryza
Lamp
Fumaria
Batra
Anoplura
Anuran


Completed Datasets (as far as I can tell):
Shenanimal
UCE
Avian
Seedplant
Pseudapis
Shenfungi
